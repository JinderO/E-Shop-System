🛠️ Technologies Used

Java 17+ - Core programming language
Advanced OOP - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstract classes
Interface Design - Discountable interface for flexible pricing
Collections Framework - ArrayList with polymorphic object storage
Business Logic - Real-world e-commerce calculations

🏗️ Architecture Overview
📁 E-Shop System
├── 📄 Product.java (Abstract base class)
├── 📄 Electronics.java (Extends Product, implements Discountable)
├── 📄 Books.java (Extends Product, implements Discountable)
├── 📄 Clothing.java (Extends Product only)
├── 📄 Discountable.java (Interface for discount behavior)
├── 📄 ShoppingCart.java (Cart management with polymorphism)
└── 📄 Main.java (Application entry point)

🎯 Key OOP Concepts Demonstrated
Inheritance Hierarchy

javaProduct (Abstract)
├── Electronics implements Discountable
├── Books implements Discountable  
└── Clothing (no discounts)

Polymorphism in Action
javaArrayList<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();
// Can store Electronics, Books, Clothing objects
// Each behaves differently for shipping and discounts

Interface Implementation
javapublic interface Discountable {
    double calculateDiscount(int quantity);
    void applySeasonalDiscount();
}
🏃‍♂️ How to Run

Clone the repository
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/eshop-system-java.git
cd eshop-system-java

Compile the project
bashjavac -d bin src/dev/jov/*.java

Run the application
bashjava -cp bin dev.jov.Main


💡 Business Logic Implementation
Product Categories with Different Shipping

Electronics: 150 Kč shipping + seasonal discounts
Books: 50 Kč shipping + quantity discounts (5+ items = 10% off)
Clothing: 80 Kč shipping + no discounts

Smart Discount System

Quantity Discounts: Automatic for eligible products
Seasonal Discounts: Applied independently
Interface-based: Easy to extend with new discount types

🧠 What I Learned

Abstract Classes vs Interfaces - When to use each approach
Polymorphic Collections - Managing different object types uniformly
Interface Segregation - Not all products need all behaviors
Business Logic Modeling - Translating real-world rules into code
Flexible Design Patterns - Easy to add new product types or discounts

🔧 Code Highlights
Polymorphic Cart Management:
javapublic double calculateTotal() {
    double total = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < products.size(); i++) {
        Product product = products.get(i);
        int quantity = quantities.get(i);
        total += (product.getPrice() * quantity) + product.calculateShipping();
    }
    return total;
}
Interface-based Discount Application:
javapublic void applyDiscounts() {
    for (Product product : products) {
        if (product instanceof Discountable) {
            ((Discountable) product).applySeasonalDiscount();
        }
    }
}
🚀 Potential Extensions

 Add user authentication system
 Implement order persistence to database
 Create web interface with Spring Boot
 Add payment processing simulation
 Implement inventory management
 Add product search and filtering
